**There are so many roles in an enterprise, and in different organizations the same role can mean different things. I therefore decided somewhere along the way to call everyone an engineer as long as they work according to the [definition of engineering](../my-preferred-definitions-of-enterprise-and-software-engineering) i.e. "...the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and empirical evidence to the innovation, design, construction, and maintenance of structures, machines, materials, devices, systems, processes, and organizations".**

This mean that roles such as e.g. Manager, Architect, Developer, Project Manager are all called Engineers on this website given that they work according to the principles of engineering. 

There will of course be times when I want to use a more precise role description, but if you see the word Engineer, you should think that it applies to all roles.


# Definition of An Engineer
> **An engineer is a professional practitioner of engineering, concerned with the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and empirical evidence to the innovation, design, construction, and maintenance of structures, machines, materials, devices, systems, processes, and organizations.**
